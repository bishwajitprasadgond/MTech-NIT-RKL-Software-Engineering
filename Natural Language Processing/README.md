Use the CKY algorithm to generate the parse tree for the sentence “fish people fish tanks”. 8 marks The probabilistic context free grammar in CNF with unarys is given in the figure below. When the start position is 0 and end position is 1, the sentence is “fish”. Looking at the grammar, we see that there are two rules that generate “fish” directly: N → fish with probability 0.2, and V → fish with probability 0.6. We place these two transitions in the location 0 to 1 corresponding to fish. There is a rule NP → N with probability 0.7 that can combine with N → fish with probability 0.2 to generate fish from NP with probability 0.7 × 0.2 = 0.14. Similarly, all the single word entries are pre-filled in the table. Fill the remaining entries in the table and generate the desired parse tree if possible from the grammar.
